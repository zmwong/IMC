"""
Loggers Package for Centralized Logging Management.

This package provides comprehensive logging management capabilities for the IMC tool,
including configuration, formatting, and centralized control of logging behavior
across all components. It ensures consistent logging practices and enables efficient
debugging and monitoring of the tool's operation.

The package includes:

- LoggingManager: Central logging management system that handles logger configuration,
  formatting, and coordination across different components. Provides unified logging
  interface and supports various logging levels, output formats, and destinations.

Key features:
- Centralized logging configuration and management
- Support for multiple logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Flexible output formatting and destination configuration
- Thread-safe logging operations for multi-threaded environments
- Integration with the IMC tool's error management system
- Performance-optimized logging for minimal impact on tool execution

The logging manager ensures that all components of the IMC tool can generate
consistent, well-formatted log output that aids in debugging, monitoring,
and operational analysis.
