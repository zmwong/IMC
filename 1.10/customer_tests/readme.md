This directory contains Intelligent Memory Checker tool preconfigured XML test files.
The objetive of these tests files are to improve user ramp up by allowing them to execute
the tool, standalone or through the python framework, without having to deal with
the process of creating XML files during their initial ramp up phase.

After the user gets familiar with the tool and all of the possible combinations
available, it is encouraged to start generating their own XML test files which
will allow them to test specific scenarios that are relevant to their use cases.
For more information on how to generate XML test files visit goto/imc.wiki
